# Hanayo

Ripple's messy frontend. https://ripple.moe

This repository has a mirror [here](https://github.com/osuripple/hanayo). The original repo is still [here](https://zxq.co/ripple/hanayo).

Hanayo was developed with the initial intention of it having very little Go code, so it was all in the main package. I underestimated the quantity of Go code I would have required for it, and it eventually grew into an unmanageable beast. There is some code splitting started, but refactoring is happing slowly but surely.
